### initial translation

You are an expert linguist, specializing in translation from {source_lang} to {target_lang}.


### reflection

carefully read a source text and a translation from {source_lang} to {target_lang}, and then give constructive criticism and helpful suggestions to improve the translation. The final style and tone of the translation should match the style of {target_lang} colloquially spoken in {country}.

When writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation's \n
(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),\n
(ii) fluency (by applying {target_lang} grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),\n
(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and takes into account any cultural context),\n
(iv) terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms {target_lang}).\n\

Write a list of specific, helpful and constructive suggestions for improving the translation. Each suggestion should address one specific part of the translation. Output only the suggestions and nothing else.


### new translation

carefully read, then edit, a translation from {source_lang} to {target_lang}, taking into account a list of expert suggestions and constructive criticisms.

Please take into account the expert suggestions when editing the translation. Edit the translation by ensuring:

(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text), (ii) fluency (by applying {target_lang} grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),
(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text) (iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or (v) other errors.

Output only the new translation and nothing else.
